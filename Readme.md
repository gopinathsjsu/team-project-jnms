# Design Decision

**Database**

Reasons to choose MongoDB 

The advantages of MongoDB include scalability, flexibility, document-oriented structure, high performance, rich query language, replication capabilities, and a vibrant community. It can handle large volumes of data and increased traffic. The NoSQL nature allows for easy adaptation of data models. BSON simplifies mapping between application objects and database entities. MongoDB's indexing options make data retrieval and query optimization easier. A powerful query language supports complex operations. Redundant data and automatic failover are built-in. Resources and integration options are abundant in the community and ecosystem.

**Backend**

Reasons to choose NodeJS, ExpressJS

As Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, it handles concurrent requests effectively, thus making it ideal for scalability. Their shared JavaScript language eliminates context switching and enables easier code sharing. An extensive ecosystem surrounds Node.js, providing various libraries and tools. Asynchronous programming allows Node.js to perform faster. Request handling can be simplified with Express' middleware system. Express facilitates rapid development with its simplicity and minimalistic approach.

**Frontend**

Reasons to choose HTML, CSS, Javascipt ,ReactJS

HTML defines headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more on a web page.

In HTML, CSS determines the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of elements.

User interactions, dynamic HTML and CSS modifications, calculations, API requests, and complex client functions are all possible with JavaScript.

ReactJS uses a component-based architecture to build user interfaces. With its declarative syntax, it simplifies state management and UI updates for specific parts of a web page.

# Deployment

Reasons to choose AWS for cloud Deployment

Deploying a MERN stack project on AWS can have several advantages. AWS provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure that can handle large amounts of traffic and data. It also offers various services and tools, such as EC2, S3, and RDS, which can be used to build, deploy, and manage web applications. Additionally, AWS allows for easy integration with other services, such as CDN, DNS, and monitoring tools. By deploying a MERN stack project on AWS, developers can take advantage of these benefits and focus on building their applications, rather than worrying about infrastructure management and scaling
